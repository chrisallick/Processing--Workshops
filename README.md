Each Sketch should:

* draw on a Photoshop/After Effects/Illustrator technique when applicable: ie blend mode, crop, shape
* build on a previous Sketch
* have a working demo demonstrating some concept: shape, how to use a library, interactivity, etc.
* have an initial next step to be coded by participant
* have two optional uncoded challenges to be codded by participants: first) very simple second) slightly more complicated
* be prefaced or followed by an idea, learning, or example that draws from the larger goal
* link to either the Learning Processing or Processing website with follow up for deeper learning
