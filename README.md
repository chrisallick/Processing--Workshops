Processing--Workshops
=====================

Initial thoughts for initial workshop sketches. These are for complete beginners.

Aprroach
=====================

Each Sketch should include:

* build on a previous Sketch
* a working demo demonstrating some concept: shape, how to use a library, interactivity, etc.
* an initial next step to be coded by participant
* two optional challenges to be codded by participants: first) very simple second) slightly more complicated
* an idea, learning, or example that draws from the larger goal
