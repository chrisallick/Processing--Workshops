Processing--Workshops
=====================

Thoughts for initial workshop sketches. These are for complete beginners.

Things to keep in mind
=====================

* I am very bad at spelling.

Tools for Jamming
=====================

Here are the tools you'll

* Processing - https://www.processing.org/
* Sublime Text 3 - http://www.sublimetext.com/3

Non-Making Lessons
=====================

* What is Git Hub?
* What is Git?
* What is the terminal?
* How do you install Processing?
* What is Processing.js?
* Processing in Sublime Text

Setting Some Stuff Up
=====================

Here are the steps we'll go through to get ready

* First we'll install Processing
* We'll download the examples
* Talk for 4 minutes about why we're here
* Start jamming

Approach
=====================

Each Sketch should:

* attempt to show a skill/process for creative output not a fundamental programming skill.
* draw on a Photoshop/After Effects/Illustrator technique when applicable: ie blend mode, crop, shape
* build on a previous Sketch
* have a working demo demonstrating some concept: shape, how to use a library, interactivity, etc.
* have an initial next step to be coded by participant
* have two optional uncoded challenges to be codded by participants: first) very simple second) slightly more complicated
* be prefaced or followed by an idea, learning, or example that draws from the larger goal
* link to either the Learning Processing or Processing website with follow up for deeper learning

Little Bit of Ideology/Philosphy: cut, copy, steal and create
=====================

I'm not 100% sure about the difference between ideology and philosophy is, but just a litte bit about why we might using Processing at all. Actually, this is a good place to start. If you saw someone attempting to draw a cat, you might say to yourself, "wow, that person is awful at drawing. they should burn that drawing before it hurts someone's eyes." However, you might even say, "jeez they are holding the pencil wrong." You would not however say, "they are being creative incorrectly." You cannot be incorrectly creative and that is very beautiful thing.

Programming is a pencil, Processing is a canvas, and combining the two is a creative process. Maybe none of these are true, but the point is that it's very easy to think someone is programming wrong, but I would disagree in the instance of programming with Processing. Even an error is intersting. Computers are dumb and they only do EXACTLY what we tell them to do, but that is neither here nor there when it comes to programming with Processing. Even if you get it wrong you're doing it right.

Making with technology increases your creative thought space. Also, creativity is a muscle and the more you use it the bigger it gets. If you are a copy writer, an art director, a graphic designer, a strategist, a business person, or undefined, programming will help you approach problems in a different way and give you insights into your craft.

At some point, hopefully even the first time you open Processing, there will be a moment in which you don't have to understand programming as much as you need to understand how to find the info you need in order to accomplish a creative task. That's learning to learn and it's very awesome.

It's also very fun, easy, and rewarding and sometimes a mistake can lead to an incredible output. It's ok to not tell anyone that you dropped your cellphone onto your keybard and accidentily created award winning generative graphics.

However, programming is hard, design is hard, being vulnerable to critique is hard, and finding time for non-obvioulsy profitible creative time is hard. So, let's find more fun ways around all of these problems.

Having said all this, the goal of these workshops is to give you some very simple non-programming centric skills that will create "ah-hah" moments of insight that will then lead to rewarding creative output. It will be very tight.

Next Steps
=====================

* in the next round of workshops we'll explore creative applications of Processing
* https://github.com/obviousjim/OFIntros
* We'll think about other tools we can use to make even more stuff: Arduino, The Web, Ruby, 3D Modeling/Printing
* We'll think about how to combine stuffs to make even more stuff: SpaceBrew
* Maybe think a bit about interactivity. Is that pencil as well? (spoiler alert: yes)
* Continue to try and re-enforce learning to learn and cut, copy, steal, create approach
